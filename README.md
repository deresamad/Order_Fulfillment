## Rationale for the Project
Order Fulfillment is a critical process that involves managing orders from customers, ensuring timely deliveries, and maintaining accurate inventories. When backlogs accumulate, they can significantly impact customer satisfaction, as delays in receiving products create dissatisfaction. In the logistics industry, managing backlogs and delays is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and ensuring smooth operations.

The reasons for this project include:

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Improving order fulfillment processes leads to enhanced customer loyalty.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Better resource allocation can help reduce costs and increase profitability.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Data can guide decisions for improving resource management and routing.
- **Reputation Management**: Consistently improving delivery processes maintains a good brand reputation, especially in a competitive Nigerian market.

## Aim of the Project
This project focuses on the creation of an Excel interactive dashboard that provides visibility into the order fulfillment process for **UTC Logistics Solutions**. Key objectives include:

- Efficiently allocate delivery resources.
- Monitor order progress and identify potential delays.
- Improve customer communication with timely updates.
- Reduce backlogs and operational costs.
- Enhance customer satisfaction.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this case study consists of:

- **Order ID**: A unique identifier for each order.
- **Delivery Address**: The address to which the order is being delivered within Nigeria.
- **Order Timestamp**: The date and time when the order was placed.
- **Order Status**: The current status of the order (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed").
- **Driver ID**: A unique identifier for each delivery driver.
- **Vehicle Info**: Information about the delivery vehicle.
- **Current Location**: The current location of the delivery driver in Nigeria.
- **Delivery Time**: Total time taken for delivery in minutes.
- **Delays**: Delays that occurred during delivery, measured in minutes.

## Tech Stack
- **Tool**: Microsoft Excel  
  Used for creating the interactive dashboard, data analysis, and visualization.
  
- **Data Processing Tools**:  
  Excel functions for data manipulation.
  
- **Visualization Tools**:  
  Excel charts, graphs, and pivot tables for visualizing data trends.

## Project Scope
The project involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Formatting and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Using statistical methods to discover patterns and anomalies in the data.
3. **Dashboard Design**: Building an interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes the data.
4. **Data Transformation**: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis.
5. **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Analyzing the data and creating visual representations to communicate insights.
6. **Documentation & Recommendations**: Comprehensive project documentation with actionable insights and recommendations.

## Insights

1. **Backlog Management**:  
   A backlog of 767 uncompleted orders out of 1500 presents a major operational challenge. Addressing this backlog is crucial to improving delivery speed and preventing further delays.

2. **Impact of Delays**:  
   The average delay of 14.51 minutes may seem small, but it accumulates, contributing to a significant backlog and delays in delivery. Reducing delays is essential for improving overall efficiency.

3. **Driver Performance**:  
   Drivers D86, D44, and D29 have higher delays than others, suggesting the need for additional training or vehicle maintenance to improve performance.

4. **Route Delays**:  
   Routes K, L, and M consistently show higher delays. Analyzing these routes for external factors like road conditions or traffic patterns in Nigerian cities could improve delivery times.

5. **Vehicle Allocation**:  
   Deliveries made with Vehicle A experience higher delays compared to Vehicle B. Reviewing the allocation of vehicles for specific routes could help optimize delivery times.

6. **Expedited vs. Custom Rules**:  
   Custom Rules have proven more effective in reducing delays than Expedited Rules. A review of the current rules is recommended to further streamline the process.

7. **Customer Satisfaction**:  
   Delayed deliveries tend to receive more negative feedback. Reducing delays could significantly improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## Recommendations

1. **Resource Allocation**:  
   Given the backlog of 767 uncompleted orders out of 1500, it is essential to allocate more resources to clear this backlog. This can be done either temporarily by hiring additional staff or on a more permanent basis by optimizing existing resources. A careful analysis of delivery volume and delivery time will help identify areas where resource allocation is needed most.

2. **Driver Training & Evaluation**:  
   Drivers with consistently higher delays (such as D86, D44, and D29) should undergo additional training. This training can focus on time management, route planning, and the use of delivery tools. Additionally, performing regular vehicle maintenance checks will help minimize delays caused by vehicle-related issues. Using a data-driven approach to track and assess driversâ€™ performance can further identify areas for improvement.

3. **Route Optimization**:  
   High-delay routes (such as K, L, and M) need to be re-evaluated. Traffic conditions, road quality, and delivery schedules should be analyzed to identify external factors contributing to delays in Nigerian cities. Based on these insights, alternate routes or more efficient scheduling could be implemented. Using route optimization software can also be a valuable tool in improving overall delivery efficiency.

4. **Vehicle Allocation**:  
   There is evidence that deliveries made with Vehicle A are facing higher delays than those made with Vehicle B. A reassessment of vehicle allocation is necessary, particularly for longer routes or bulkier shipments. It may be more efficient to assign Vehicle A to routes with shorter distances or lighter deliveries, while reserving Vehicle B for longer or more complex routes. Regular vehicle performance tracking should be implemented to ensure optimal vehicle utilization.

5. **Expedited vs. Custom Rules**:  
   The analysis indicates that Custom Rules have proven to be more effective in reducing delays compared to Expedited Rules. A review of the current rules is recommended. Expedited Rules should be refined to ensure they are being applied effectively, while a focus should be placed on improving Custom Rules. Streamlining these rules will help reduce delays more effectively and optimize the order fulfillment process.

6. **Customer Communication**:  
   Delayed deliveries are often accompanied by negative customer feedback. It is important to enhance communication channels with customers, providing them with real-time updates on their orders, expected delays, and other concerns. Implementing automated notifications and ensuring that customer service representatives are readily available to answer inquiries will improve customer satisfaction. Proactively managing customer expectations will help maintain trust and loyalty.
